## Welcome

In this scenario, we will be walking through installing components to practice **Continuous Delivery** in a **Cloud Native** environment.

We will be using two virtual machines (that can be accessed from the tabs, in the panel of the right):

- `management01`: Kubernetes single-node cluster with management tools
- `workload01`: Kubernetes single-node cluster with user workload

You can pause/resume if needed to avoid the machines to get deleted.
